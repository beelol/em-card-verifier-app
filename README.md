## Live App

You can access the live app [here](https://em-card-verifier-app.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

Before using this application locally, you'll need to run the [em-card-verifier-api](https://github.com/beelol/em-card-verifier-api) on your machine as well.

First, run the development server. pnpm is recommended:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
